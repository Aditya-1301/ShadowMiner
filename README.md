# [Shadow Miner](https://photon-phantom.itch.io/shadow-miner)

This is supposed to be a simple single player survival game inspired by the classic Miniclip gold miner game. This game was made with Godot 4.22. This game was originally made by us as an entry in the Pirate Software Game Jam 15 (Summer 2024). The Theme of the game jam was Shadows and Alchemists. 

## Game Summary

Our main character is an alchemist with magical powers who is looking for materials in a dark cave full of monsters to make some gold. Since he is moving through the dark he will have to be careful about what he picks up as the items he picks up can be cursed and he has to be careful of his surroundings as while he tries to pick up items he can be ambushed by the creatures in the dark (like crows, shadow creatures etc). The idea is to be able to find enough gold within the time limit, which would help our alchemist in the acquisition of the sought-after philosopher's stone.

## Game Mechanics Overview

1. There will be items which would be at the top of the screen which can be attracted by the player to meet the objectives at each stage. There will be different types of items:
  - _Money Items_: gold and rock
  - _Buff / Multiplier Items_: Increases the value of any Money items which the player gains after getting this item for 5-10s.
  - _Debuff Items_: Lower attraction force, making gold gathering slower for 5s
  - _Time Bonus_: +5/10 s on the timer.
  - _Progression Item_: Philosopherâ€™s Shard

2. Player Controls:
  - The player can move around using the Arrow keys. 
  - The player can jump using the spacebar. 
  - The player can press and hold the left mouse button to use the attraction capabilities of the staff, and releasing the button will stop the effect.
  - The player can use the [right mouse button?] to attack incoming enemies.
  - There will be enemies coming from either side of the screen and the player will be standing in the center.  These are the enemies one can expect to encounter in the game:
    - Crows
    - Shadow Creatures
